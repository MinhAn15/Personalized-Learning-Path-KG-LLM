Question_Number,type,correct,explanation,options
1,multiple_choice,0,"A transaction is a sequence of database operations executed as a single unit, ensuring data integrity.","A sequence of database operations executed as a single unit,A single database operation,A sequence of unrelated database operations,A sequence of database operations executed in parallel"
2,multiple_choice,0,A bank transfer involving withdrawal and deposit is an example of a transaction as it involves multiple database operations executed as a single unit.,"A bank transfer involving withdrawal and deposit,A single SELECT query,Updating a single record in a database,Deleting multiple records in a database"
3,multiple_choice,0,The main goal of understanding transactions in databases is to ensure data integrity.,"Ensuring data integrity,Improving database performance,Reducing storage space,Increasing data redundancy"
4,multiple_choice,0,Transactions are important in database management to ensure data integrity by executing a sequence of operations as a single unit.,"To ensure data integrity,To increase data redundancy,To reduce database performance,To complicate database operations"
5,multiple_choice,0,"If a transaction fails midway through execution, the database is rolled back to its original state to maintain data integrity.","The database is rolled back to its original state,The database commits all changes made so far,The database becomes read-only,The database crashes"
6,multiple_choice,0,"Transactions help maintain data integrity by ensuring all operations are executed as a single unit, preventing partial updates or inconsistencies.","By ensuring all operations are executed as a single unit,By allowing parallel execution of operations,By ignoring error messages,By increasing data redundancy"
7,multiple_choice,0,"The purpose of using transactions in database management is to ensure the ACID properties: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.","To ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties),To increase data redundancy,To speed up database operations,To allow parallel execution of operations"
8,multiple_choice,0,Atomicity is a property of transactions in databases that ensures all operations are executed as a single unit.,"Atomicity,Redundancy,Parallelism,Inconsistency"
9,multiple_choice,0,The isolation property of transactions in databases refers to ensuring that the intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions until it is committed.,"Ensuring that the intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions,Allowing multiple transactions to execute concurrently,Committing changes made by a transaction immediately,Rolling back a transaction if it fails"
10,multiple_choice,0,The durability property of transactions ensures data integrity by persisting changes made by a transaction even in the event of a system failure.,"By persisting changes made by a transaction even in the event of a system failure,By rolling back a transaction if it fails,By allowing parallel execution of transactions,By increasing data redundancy"
