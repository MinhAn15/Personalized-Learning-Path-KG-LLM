### 2.5.5. Process Mining trong Educational Analytics

Process Mining lÖ cìng c? phÉn t°ch event logs, ph†t hi?n bottlenecks, ?o l??ng conformance gi?a l? trçnh th?c t? vÖ ?? xu?t.

- Process Discovery: S? d?ng Alpha algorithm, Heuristic Miner... cho learning logs.
- Conformance Checking: So s†nh actual paths v?i recommended path qua Log Skeleton:
  - Always Before / After
  - Equivalence / Never Together
- Conformance Metric:
[Fitness = 1 - ( |Violations| / |Total Constraints| )]
- ?ng d?ng: `backend/src/process_mining.py` dóng pm4py ?? phÉn t°ch logs, tr? v? t°nh l?ch, t?n su?t, completion rate, vÖ v? flow chart.

B?ng ?? xu?t: Bottleneck concepts (top dropout rate), Completion Rate, Average Deviation t? l? trçnh chu?n.
